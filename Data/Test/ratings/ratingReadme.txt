The 'Ratings.mat' saves the sketch-image pairwise ratings.
There are ratings of 14 categories stored in 14 cells of a matrix.
In each category's cell, there is a 60 x 24 matrix. The rows of the matrix represent 60 images, and the row numbers correpond to
the image files' storing order in the alphabetical fashion. The columns of the matrix represent sketches' similarities to the images 
in the 4 criteria. Each consecutive 4 columns belong to 1 sketch, and are in the order of V(View), C(Configuration), B(Body), Z(Zoom).
